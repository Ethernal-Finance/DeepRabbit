# DeepRabbit FAQ

## What is DeepRabbit?
DeepRabbit is a real-time AI music performance tool that lets you shape evolving tracks with natural language prompts and MIDI hardware.

## How do I curate styles?
Open the Tracks panel and browse or search for styles. Add as many as you like, then choose up to eight to place on the performance grid.

## Can I toggle styles during a performance?
Yes. Use the Tracks panel to enable or disable styles in real time. You can also map MIDI controls to quickly toggle slots on and off.

## Do I need a subscription?
No. The app now runs without any subscription or checkout.

## My MIDI controller isn't detected. What can I do?
Ensure your browser supports Web MIDI and that you've granted permissions. Refresh the page or reconnect the controller and try again.

## Where can I get help?
Check the troubleshooting section in the README or contact support at support@deeprabbit.net.
